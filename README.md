 # CodeGenie — AI Explainer & Code Generator

*  CodeGenie — AI Explainer & Code Generator
🏆 Milestone 1 — Static Analysis & Multi-Model Explainers

🎓 Program: Infosys Virtual Springboard Internship 6.0

🔍 Project Overview

CodeGenie is an AI-powered assistant built to explain and eventually generate code with deep, project-level understanding. Unlike standard code assistants, CodeGenie analyzes a developer’s unique codebase through AST parsing, token analysis, and NLP-based embeddings, enabling smarter, context-aware code explanations.

Milestone 1 serves as the foundation — demonstrating how to parse, analyze, and explain Python snippets using both rule-based logic and transformer-based AI models.

🎯 Objectives

✅ Parse 10+ Python snippets using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
✅ Extract functions, classes, imports, and patterns
✅ Perform tokenization and analyze keyword/operator frequency
✅ Generate embeddings using 3 pretrained NLP models:
• MiniLM (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
• DistilRoBERTa (paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v1)
• MPNet (all-mpnet-base-v2)
✅ Compare model outputs & visualize similarities via PCA and bar charts

🧩 Methodology

Static Code Parsing — Extract structure (functions, classes, imports) using Python’s ast module.

Tokenization & Pattern Analysis — Identify keywords, operators, and token categories.

Rule-Based Explanations — Generate plain-English line-by-line code explanations.

NLP Model Explainers — Use SentenceTransformer models for deep contextual analysis.

Visualizations — Create bar charts, pie charts, word clouds, and PCA scatterplots to reveal insights.

🧠 Key Observations

✨ MiniLM and MPNet produced higher similarity in embeddings compared to DistilRoBERTa.
✨ AST parsing accurately identified all structural elements in the code.
✨ Visualizations revealed semantic clustering among functionally similar snippets.
✨ Combined static + semantic analysis proved effective for intelligent code understanding.

⚙️ How to Run

📍 Install required libraries: sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, nltk, etc.
📍 Open the Jupyter/Colab notebook Milestone_1.ipynb.
📍 Execute cells sequentially to generate all analysis reports and plots.

🧭 Roadmap

Milestone 2: Build a retrieval system and vector store.
Milestone 3: Integrate RAG for project-aware explanations.
Milestone 4: Develop an IDE plugin for interactive explain & generate workflows.

💡 Summary

CodeGenie Milestone 1 successfully combines AST-based static analysis with transformer-powered explanations, offering a visual and analytical foundation for building a truly context-aware AI code assistant.

## 🔍 Project Overview
